## Airbnb Data Deep Dive – Python + Pandas Challenge

## Overview
I've learned the core concepts of Python and Pandas, now it's time to apply them to a real-world dataset. This challenge will test your ability to clean, transform, and analyze a complex dataset using only Python and Pandas.

You’ll be working with Airbnb listing data from a major city. Your goal is to uncover patterns, clean messy data, create insightful summaries, and answer key analytical questions using only Pandas.

Dataset
Download Airbnb data for a city of your choice from Inside Airbnb. Cities like New York City or London are ideal due to their large dataset sizes and variety.

You’ll primarily be working with the listings.csv file.
